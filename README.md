[Motion parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception#Monocular_cues) is created by the apparent relative motion of objects when an observer moves. It is one of the monocular cues that enables depth perception. This [demo](https://vivien000.github.io/trompeloeil/) simulates this phenomenon thanks to the facial landmarks pretrained model made available by [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/models).
